## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.


| Page | W3C URL                                                                                             | Screenshot |                                          |Notes            |
| ---  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Friiyu7.github.io%2FMilan-Food-CA%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/home-page-w3.png) | pass: No errors |
| Menu | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Friiyu7.github.io%2FMilan-Food-CA%2Fmenu.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/Menu-page-w3.png) | pass: No errors |


### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File      | Jigsaw URL                                                                                                 | Screenshot                                                    | Notes           |
| --------- | ---------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |

## Browser Compatibility

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device                | Home                                                           | Menu                                                             |   Notes            |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile                                                    | Desktop                                                   | Notes               |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------  | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/la-home-mobile.png)   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/la-home-desktop.png)  | Some minor warnings |
| Menu | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/la-menu-mobile.png)   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/la-menu-desktop.png)  | Some minor warnings |

The main issues I faced with the home screen for both desktop and mobile are the following:
