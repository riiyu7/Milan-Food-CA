# [MILANS FOOD & SWEET CENTER](https://riiyu7.github.io/Milan-Food-CA)

![Milans Food & Sweet Center](documentation/mockup.png)

We invite you to come and indulge in authentic Indian food with the 'Milans' family, where the taste of India is brought to you. The 'Milanâ€™s family cater for everyone whether that will be for individuals, weddings or corporate events. Come and experience the taste of India with us.

This website displays the type of food we supply to our customers, as well as the services we offer. The information provided on the website provides an insight into our business and how we can help our customers.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

I primarily chose Maroon (#800000) to be used for my headings and logo as it represents a 'divine spark' in some indian culture as well as a connection to 'Mother Earth' and given that we use so many spices the colour seemed very fitting. To give the primary colour a good contrast I used White (#FFFFFF).

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/800000-3a3a3a-ffd591-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Cabin] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) was used throughout the website

- [sans-serif] was used as a secondary text if cabin failed.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Experience

## Goals

- Create a simple but visually appealing website.
- Quality and valuable content that is clear and straight to the point.
- Easy to use and navigate through website and Menu link.
- Responsive design on all devices.

### New Site Users

As a new site user, I would not want to see a webpage that is cluttered or hard to use, I would like to see something that provides me information quick and efficiently.

When I look at a food website as a new user, my first go to link would be the Menu so I can get a little understanding of the type of food they will have. Im also not a fan of downloading PDF's onto my device so preferably id like to see the information on one page.

As I site user and potential client, I want to easily find out opening times and contact information so i know what days the business is closed.



### Returning Site Users

As returning user, I want to be able to access the website through my phone at times I might be on the go, I would want to see similarities in the page from desktop and mobile so its easy to navigate.
