# [MILANS FOOD & SWEET CENTER](https://riiyu7.github.io/Milan-Food-CA)

![Milans Food & Sweet Center](documentation/mockup.png)

We invite you to come and indulge in authentic Indian food with the 'Milans' family, where the taste of India is brought to you. The 'Milanâ€™s family cater for everyone whether that will be for individuals, weddings or corporate events. Come and experience the taste of India with us.

This website displays the type of food we supply to our customers, as well as the services we offer. The information provided on the website provides an insight into our business and how we can help our customers.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

I primarily chose Maroon (#800000) to be used for my headings and logo as it represents a 'divine spark' in some indian culture as well as a connection to 'Mother Earth' and given that we use so many spices the colour seemed very fitting. To give the primary colour a good contrast I used White (#FFFFFF).

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/800000-3a3a3a-ffd591-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Cabin] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) was used throughout the website

- [sans-serif] was used as a secondary text if cabin failed.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Experience

## Goals

- Create a simple but visually appealing website.
- Quality and valuable content that is clear and straight to the point.
- Easy to use and navigate through website and Menu link.
- Responsive design on all devices.

### New Site Users

User 1 -  As a new site user, I would not want to see a webpage that is cluttered or hard to use, I would like to see something that provides me information quick and efficiently.

User 2 - When I look at a food website as a new user, my first go to link would be the Menu so I can get a little understanding of the type of food they will have. Im also not a fan of downloading PDF's onto my device so preferably id like to see the information on one page.

### Returning Site Users

User 1 - As returning user, I can see the webpage is easily viewable on my desktop and phone and it is not cluttered. The information displayed is clear and concise 

User 2- As returning user, I can see there is a menu link which displays all items on one page and is easy to use and navigate. Overall i like the design and the fact that social media links are provided below.
